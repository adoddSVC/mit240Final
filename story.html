<h2>Setting</h2>
<p>The Sacred Stones takes place on the continent of Magvel. It is home to six nation-states, with each nation having their own unique culture and variant governments ranging from monarchies to a democrat-republic type nation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renais: The kingdom of Renais is ruled by Fado, the peerless Warrior King. It is the home of the twin lords Ephraim and Eirika. </li>
<li>Frelia: The kingdom of Frelia is ruled by Hayden, the venerable Sage King and the father of the pegasus knight Tana and the sniper Innes. Frelia is also home to pegasi which are trained for military purposes.</li>
<li>Jehanna: The kingdom of Jehanna is ruled by Ismaire, the Queen of the White Dunes. Her son is Joshua, the myrmidon. Since the nation exists mostly out of desert, there seem to be a heavy focus on being a mercenary in order to earn your daily bread.</li>
<li>Rausten: The theocracy of Rausten is ruled by Mansel, the Divine Emperor, where in he claims to be a descendant of the saintly Latona. His heir is his niece L'Arachel, the troubadour. It was founded by the saintly Latona, one of the Five Heroes.</li>
<li>Grado: The Grado Empire is ruled by Vigarde, the Silent Emperor. His son, the necromancer Lyon, is a good friend of Ephraim and Eirika, who are appalled and confused by Grado's sudden betrayal. Grado is the largest country of Magvel and its eponymous founder, Grado, was the leader of the Five Heroes who stood against the Demon King. It is the main antagonistic country in the game.</li>
<li>Carcino: The emerging mercantile republic of Carcino is governed by a council of elders, and, unlike the other nations of Magvel, is more of a democratic-republic nation than a monarchy or theocracy. It was established more recently than the other nations and is the only nation not founded by one of the Five Heroes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Stone 803, the Grado Empire, a long-standing ally of Renais, launched a surprise attack on Renais, ordered by Emperor Vigarde. Renais is unable to mount resistance against such a swift and forceful attack. Prince Ephraim of Renais is nowhere to be found as Grado sweeps through territory after territory. King Fado of Renais orders his trusted general, Seth, to take his daughter Princess Eirika to safety in neighboring Frelia while he stays behind in order to discover the motives behind Grado's sudden attack.<br><br>

King Hayden of Frelia helps Eirika and suggests that she remain until Prince Ephraim returns, however she is determined to find him and goes to Grado. Aided by several of Hayden's retainers, Eirika travels towards Grado where her brother was last seen. Passing through Renais once again, they see first-hand the devastation caused by the war. Even more troubling is the appearance of foul undead creatures throughout the world. In the village of Serafew, Eirika encounters a former Grado cleric called Natasha. She tells Eirika of Emperor Vigarde's plan to destroy the Sacred Stones that safeguard the land from evil.<br><br>
Meanwhile, Prince Ephraim has been causing havoc in Grado territory. As part of his guerrilla campaign to disrupt Grado's military efficiency, he decides to capture the strategic Fort Renvall. However, after a brilliant tactical victory, he is forced to flee by Grado's army.<br><br>

After recovering Eirika's bracelet from a mysterious man, Seth reveals its true importance; along with Ephraim's bracelet, they open the secret door to Renais's Sacred Stone. Eirika presses on to Fort Renvall, hot on Ephraim's trail. Inside, she finds Orson, one of Ephraim's guards. He offers to lead her to Ephraim's prison cell. However, Orson has betrayed Renais for a chance to resurrect his wife and traps Eirika inside the fort, forcing her to fight her way through. During the battle, Ephraim arrives and with their combined strength, they seize the fort.<br><br>

After their reunion, they return to Frelia to plan their next move. They wonder what happened to the peace-loving Prince Lyon of Grado who would surely disapprove of his father's war.<br><br>
</p>
<h1>Eirika's Quest</h1>
<p>Eirika and Ephraim decide to enlist the help of the other nations in combating the global threat posed by Grado's aggressive campaign to destroy the Sacred Stones. To save time, they decide that Eirika will sail to warn Rausten of the war, Prince Innes of Frelia will go to warn Jehanna and Ephraim will attack Castle Grado directly.<br><br>
At the port, no ship will sail because of a ghost ship that terrorizes the seas (dealt with on Ephraim's route). She has no choice but to take the overland route to Rausten, which goes through the Republic of Carcino, the only country in Magvel with no ties to a Sacred Stone. There, Eirika finds Prince Innes and his group under attack by Carcino soldiers under orders from Councilman Pablo, who has allied with Grado. After triumphing against the mercenary army, they discover Councilman Klimt, the man who Pablo was hunting and trying to assassinate with his mercenaries. Klimt tells her that Pablo was the one who decided to side with Grado, and that not all of Carcino was against Renais.<br><br>

United with Innes, they continue their march towards Jehanna. During a run-in with some monsters along the way, they are joined by a zealous monster-hunter called L'Arachel and her cheerful bodyguard Dozla. To avoid more conflict, they take a mountainous route through the secluded village of Caer Pelyn, led by a young mage called Ewan. In a mountain valley on their journey to Jehanna, they are confronted by Glen, the Sunstone general of the Grado empire. Eirika convinces him to let her proceed. Not long after she leaves, Valter confronts Glen and assassinates him.<br><br>

When the army reaches Caer Pelyn, they are again attacked by monsters. Ewan's mentor Saleh offers to guide them to Jehanna. At the midpoint from Caer Pelyn to Jehanna, the group passes through Hamill Canyon. Meanwhile, Valter has returned to the Grado capital and shown Glen's brother, Cormag, the corpse of the former general. Valter tells Cormag that Glen was killed by Eirika. Outraged, Cormag flies to Hamill canyon to get revenge. The two forces meet, but Eirika convinces Cormag of the truth and he joins her to gain revenge on Valter.<br><br>

When they finally arrive in Jehanna, they find the Palace under siege by Grado. After a long and tiring battle, Eirika discovers the Queen Ismaire of Jehanna, mortally wounded by the axe of Grado's Tiger Eye General Caellach. Even worse, Jehanna's Sacred Stone has been destroyed. With her dying breath, Queen Ismaire calls to her son Joshua, a young myrmidon whom Eirika met in Serafew and the disguised prince. While these events took place, enemy soldiers had set fire to the palace.<br><br>

Barely escaping with their lives, Eirika finds herself trapped between the forces of two of Grado's generals: Caellach and Valter. In the middle of a desperate escape, Ephraim rushes to her aid with reinforcements. The joined quest begins.<br><br></p>
<h1>Ephraim's Quest</h1>
<p>After splitting up with his sister, Ephraim ventures to Grado. During this journey, he encounters many forces from Grado alongside mercenary groups attempting to capture him. First, in Fort Rigwald, Ephraim finds Tana, the princess of Frelia, and frees her from her kidnappers. Next, he recruits Duessel, the Obsidian General in Grado's army and Ephraim's former training master, who is dubious of the intentions of Emperor Vigarde. Duessel mentions a "Dark Stone" to Ephraim, a substance that Lyon extraced from Grado's Sacred Stone. The group suspects that the occult powers of the Dark Stone are the cause of Emperor Vigarde's change in personality.<br><br>

During the same battle in which Duessel switches allegiances, Duessel encounters Cormag, a Wyvern Rider whose brother, Glen, has been murdered (see Eirika's story). Duessel convinced him to join Ephraim.<br><br>
	
Ephraim takes a sea route to Grado, but is hindered by a ghost ship said to be sinking any ships it encounters. After he deals with the problem and arrives in Grado, he is attacked by Grado forces combined with monsters sent by the Blood Beryl, Riev. Shortly after, in the Za'albul Marsh, Ephraim defeats General Selena Fluorspar, receiving a dragonstone stolen from his friend Myrrh. Ephraim arrives in Grado Keep and defeats Emperor Vigarde, who, bizarrely, cannot speak. Following the battle with Ephraim, Vigarde's body crumbles to dust.<br><br>

Lyon appears to Ephraim, and tells Ephraim that they are now enemies and that it was he that started the war. Ephraim learns the secret of the Dark Stone (also known as the Fire Emblem) from Knoll, a researcher of ancient magic and assistant to Lyon before he discovered the Dark Stone. Ephraim then learns of his sister being ambushed by Caellach and Valter at Jehanna Hall. He rushes to meet her, still burdened by the knowledge that his former best friend was the cause of the war. He eventually reaches his destination and the two siblings are reunited.<br><br></p>
<h1>Joint Quest (15-Epilogue)</h1>
<p>Ephraim meets up with Eirika in the desert, and they defeat Caellach and Valter. When Ephraim and Eirika reunite their forces, they find Renais in a state of chaos, under the tyrannical rule of the traitor Orson. After they defeat him, they find a hideous creature in Orson's chamber that resembles his wife Monica. Monica's mannerisms resemble those of Emperor Vigarde, and they destroy her and discover that it was created by the same dark sorcery as the Emperor. After securing their homeland, Ephraim and Eirika receive Renais' legendary weapons Sieglinde and Siegmund, and their Sacred Stone. They decide to head to Rausten to secure the last remaining stone. As they continue, they are supposed to meet up with Frelian reinforcements, but all are killed by Grado remnants apart from their commander Syrene, who then joins Ephraim and Eirika's army. The twins meet Lyon, who has radically changed from the friend they once knew. He retreats into the mountains, and the twins give chase. This leads them into a trap filled with Gorgons and their hatching eggs that dot the mountains. However, the army is victorious over the sulphur fumes, demons, intense heat and molten magma, and one of the twins goes to confront Lyon.<br><br>

When following Ephraim's quest, Ephraim approaches Lyon, who freezes Ephraim, takes the Sacred Stone, and crushes it. Ephraim argues with him and asks what happened to him. Lyon reveals that the possessed form is a drama and that everything he had done had been under his own free will.<br><br>

Along Eirika's journey, Lyon's soul has been almost entirely consumed by the Demon King, with his body under the King's complete control. He convinces Eirika to give him the Stone by mimicking Lyon and saying that he needs the stone to drive out the Demon King, then crushes it. Lyon says that he will be in Darkling Woods, and teleports away.<br><br>
	
Eirika and Ephraim take time to rest at Rausten Court and to obtain Rausten's Sacred Stone, the only surviving one. Rausten Court is invaded by the last Grado General, Riev, who seeks revenge for his exile years before. After repelling the attack, the army give chase to Darkling Woods to stop Lyon from performing a ceremony which he has tricked the last remaining piece of the real Lyon into believing will stop a natural disaster from occurring in Grado in the future. However, the ceremony only leads to the full resurrection of the mastermind behind all of these events: Fomortiis, the Demon King.<br><br>

The army arrives in Darkling Woods and confronts the resurrected Formotiis. Although they seal his soul in the Sacred Stone, his body still attacks them. Eirika, Ephraim, and their army defeat him with the help of five countries' Sacred Twin weapons. Thus the war ends, and with his body destroyed, Formotiis is unable to be resurrected again.<br><br>

In the aftermath, the remaining Sacred Stone is sealed away and peace returns to Magvel, though the continent is left in disarray after the war, as many places were destroyed, and the landslide prophesized to destroy Grado does occur. However, the future looks bright, as Eirika and Ephraim set about restoring their nation while deciding to aid Grado, vowing to achieve Lyon's wishes that all may live in peace and joy.<br><br></p>
