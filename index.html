<h2>Development</h2>
<p>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones (Japanese: ファイアーエムブレム 聖魔の光石 Fire Emblem: Light Stones of Saints and Demons) is a Japanese tactical role-playing game for the Game Boy Advance developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. It was released on October 7, 2004 in Japan, and was later localized and released on May 23, 2005 in North America. It is the eighth game in the Fire Emblem series, the third and final game in the series to be released for the Game Boy Advance and the second game in the series to be released outside Japan.
The game builds on the game mechanics used in the previous two Game Boy Advance Fire Emblem titles; Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade and Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade; but takes place on a different continent. Set on the continent of Magvel, the plot focuses on royal twins Princess Eirika and Prince Ephraim as they investigate why a longtime ally has chosen to invade their nation's borders and the sudden appearance of monsters all over Magvel.

Though it received positive reviews, The Sacred Stones was criticized for making only superficial improvements over the previous game. Reviews also stated that the new "World Map" feature made the game too easy. Despite these comments, the game received an average rating of 85 percent on Game Rankings and has sold over 300,000 copies in Japan.

The Sacred Stones was represented in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, with music and stickers..</p>
