<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones introduces several new concepts and revives some old ones used in previous Fire Emblem games. The most notable change is the map system, which allows the player to have more control of how much experience the team gets and thus how they level-up. Despite this, it is similar to Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade and Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade in terms of actual gameplay.<br><br></p>
<h1>Combat</h1>
<p>The Sacred Stones retains the basic gameplay fundamentals seen in Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade; such mechanics like the weapon and magic triangles are identical to the previous game. The main battles in the story and the storyline associated with each battle are divided as chapters; the game has twenty-one chapters in the main story and only one side chapterâ€”an optional battle during the main course of the game. There are also six chapters in each of Eirika's and Ephraim's routes, all of which are different in each route. There are twenty-eight chapters in total during the main course of the game.<br><br></p>
<p>A notable difference that separates The Sacred Stones from the previous Game Boy Advance Fire Emblem titles is the use of a navigable world map, a mechanic first used in Fire Emblem Gaiden. Rather than limit the ability to train units and buy items to story battles, the ability to traverse the world map allows players more freedom in choosing how to play the game. It is possible to purchase weapons and items by visiting shops at points scattered across Magvel. Basic iron weapons and low-level tomes can also be purchased at an inflated cost from the armory in the Supply Convoy before battle, and units can pull items from the supply caravan during battle when standing adjacent to the main character (i.e. Eirika or Ephraim). It is also possible to enter "Skirmish" battles against monsters unrelated to the story.<br><br>
The Sacred Stones, like Fire Emblem Gaiden, features monsters, all of which appear only as enemies. They are divided into traditional monster types, like zombies and gargoyles. The monsters can be battled in some chapters in the main game, as well as in side-battles on the map.<br><br></p>
<h1>Units</h1>
<p>The Sacred Stones also introduces a branching class-change system. Like the previous Game Boy Advance titles, units must use specific items to change class. Unlike previous titles the player is now given a choice in what type of advanced class a character can become, for example, Wyvern Riders may become either Wyvern Lords or Wyvern Knights. The only units that do not get to choose between classes are the two Lords, Eirika and Ephraim, who each change into their own unique class.<br><br>
Trainee classes were introduced in The Sacred Stones, which precede some of the previously basic classes. These include Journeyman, Recruit and Pupil. Characters that are in a trainee class gain more experience than usual, and when they reach Level 10, they stop gaining experience and can class-change at the beginning of the next battle without the aid of an item. As with other classes, players can choose one of two basic classes to class-change into. After certain criteria are met, the trainee classes have a third class-change option, which is a slightly stronger version of the original trainee class.<br><br>
The skill system was first introduced in Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War, and made a return in The Sacred Stones. In The Sacred Stones, some unit classes have a unique skill that gives it an advantage in battle. For example, the Bishop's "Slayer" skill triples a weapon's might when fighting monsters. Unlike in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, there is no capacity gauge, and the skills are not assigned by the player. The skills cannot be removed from the unit.</p><br><br>
<h1>Alternative Modes</h1>
<p>The Sacred Stones features a multiplayer Link Arena structured identically to that found in the previous game.<br><br>
There are three difficulties to choose from:</p>
<li>Easy - For beginners, this mode gives players tips on how to play the game. Enemies are slightly weaker compared to normal mode, with the lone exception of bosses on the main storyline, which follow normal mode values</li>
<li>Normal - For players who are somewhat familiar to the series, this mode gives a moderate challenge and does not offer tips.</li>
<li>Hard - For players experienced to the series, it does not offer tips like normal mode. All enemies are slightly stronger in this mode.</li>
<p>in addition, "Creature Campaign" is unlocked for a file when the main storyline is completed (this overwrites that file). Creature Campaign offers several prominent characters in the main storyline when the player completes certain achievements in the Tower of Valni or Lagdou Ruins.<br><br></p>
<h1>Supports</h1>
<p>There are thirty-three units in The Sacred Stones that can engage in support conversations. The support system works as exactly the same as in Fire Emblem's support system, in both the advantages that they offer and the way they can be obtained; as in Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, a "support viewer" is available in which all attained support conversations can be re-read. Support conversations can be attained in the optional skirmish battles and extra battles in the Creature Campaign.<br><br></p>
